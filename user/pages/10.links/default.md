## Websites {#websites}

[Idlewords](https://idlewords.com) <a id="idlewords"></a>

:   The essay blog of *Maciej Cegłowski*, the brilliant and somewhat iconoclastic anti-entreprenuer and founder of Pinboard, the anti-social bookmarking service. I especially enjoy [Shuffleboard at McMurdo](https://idlewords.com/2016/05/shuffleboard_at_mcmurdo.htm) about his tourist trip to Antartica. 

Kicks Condor <a id="kickscondor"></a>

:   The blog of a guy passionate about personal websites, the indie web, discovery, and oldschool blogging (maybe?). Lots of links to lots of treasures in here. This site got me excited about personal websites again. I'm [not allowed to link to him](https://www.kickscondor.com/okay-shut-up-about-me-now)[^1] <sup>(Take solace, Kicks, in the fact that if someone were to follow *this* link to your site and find their screen suddenly filled by this convoluted rant, they'll surely close the window immediately and never visit again)</sup>, so you'll have to type the words into your search engine.

<a href="http://gossips.cafe/">Gossip's Cafe</a> <a id="gossipscafe"></a>

:    A tiny online community in the form of a virtual cafe. I love this so much. The cafe is only open from 8am - 7pm daily. You can chat with other visitors to the cafe, but all messages disappear after 8 hours. There are different areas where you can post links. I think they change daily—right now it's Tunes and Coffee Break. During closed hours you can drop by and leave an emoji, which shows up in the lost+found section when the cafe opens. The whole thing is just so sweet. I love finding community projects like this.

<a href="https://special.fish">Special Fish</a> <a id="specialfish"></a>

:    Another tiny whimsical social network by the [same luminous internet community builder](http://bellkiosk.site/) as Gossip's Cafe. You get to choose a username and a color, you get to choose a community to reside in (represented by a little symbol), you get to post lists of things, you get to be a fan of 9 other users, and...that's it!

## Things {#things}

AirPods <a id="airpods"></a>

:   Apple likes to throw the word "magic" around, but AirPods really do feel a little bit magic. I was late on the AirPod train and bought a pair second-hand from a friend, and they immediately become one of my favorite accessories.

    They're just so gosh darn easy to pop in quick. If my phone starts ringing, I can take the case from my pocket, put in an AirPod, and take the call before it goes to voicemail. The case is so small and round I often forget they're even in my pocket (and I hate having things in my pockets). They've also been great for listening to music or podcasts while walking or running, which is something I never had a great solution for.

Chainmail cast iron scrubber <a id="chainmail"></a>

:   These things are the single best thing you can do for your cast iron pans. See my full [cast-iron care](/food/cast-iron) page.

## Apps & Services {#apps}

[You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) <a id="ynab"></a>

:   YNAB is a zero-based envelop budgeting system. Any time you earn money, you immediately assign each dollar to a category for its intended purpose until you have *zero* dollars left to assign. This is an analogy of the old envelope-based budgeting where you put money into physical envelopes for rent, groceries, etc. In YNAB, once a category is empty, you're out of money to spend on that thing—you can easily move money from a different category to cover it, but it forces you to be intentional about it. You're making a choice to move available funds from your Vacation category to your Dining Out category. You immediately know what the repurcussions of buying that burger are going to be. It takes a bit to wrap your head around the YNAB methodology, but it's well worth it.
