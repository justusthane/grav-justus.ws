It's a mild allergic reaction to social media. Itâ€™s a place to put things I care about. It's in the tradition of putting time into creating a personal website as a creative expression. Remember GeoCities? It's a modern GeoCities site. It's Web 1.0. It's a personal website.

It's inspired by [grupstrarules.com](https://grupstrarules.com), the website of a guy I thought was pretty cool in high school, and [bobbyburgess.net/journal](https://web.archive.org/web/20060908213315/http://www.bobbyburgess.net/journal/?date=20060321), a blog I used to love. All that remains of Bobby Burgess is what can be found on the Wayback Machine, which isn't much. You got the sense from his blog he had a hard life. I wonder what happened to him.

I also believe it's in your best interest to control your online brand, no matter who you are. You should determine the first result when someone [googles](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=justus+grunow) your name. Don't hand over control of your digital life.
