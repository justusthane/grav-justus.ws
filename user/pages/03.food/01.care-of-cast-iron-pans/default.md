A search for [cast iron pan care](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=cast+iron+pan+care) yields a *lot* of results. There are as many opinions on how to properly use and take care of cast iron pans as there are people who own cast iron pans.

Here’s what I’ve found works best for me.

## Seasoning
When people talk about “seasoning” cast iron, they’re talking about the building up of a solidified (“*polymerized*”) layer of oil on the surface of the pan. It’s this solid layer that gives the pan non-stick properties.

I’ve seen articles [like this one](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/) advocating the use of flaxseed oil because of its polymerizing properties. It’s expensive though, so I haven’t bothered. I tend to start by just spreading a thin later of vegetable oil on the pan, and baking it in the oven for about an hour at 350F.

After that, the seasoning will continue to improve over time (with proper care) as you cook in the pan. Just remember to use lots of oil at first—the non-stick properties won’t be perfect yet.

## Use
Cast iron is great. Just use it. Just a few things to try to avoid:
- Try not to get it really hot without anything in it. You risk scorching and ruining your seasoning.
- Try not to cook really acidic things—or example, simmering spaghetti sauce for an extended amount of time. The acid will eat away your seasoning.

## Washing
There are a *lot* of opinions of how to properly wash cast iron. The thing most people agree on is don’t use soap…except I do.

I used to subscribe to the no-wash method. I’d just give them a quick wipe after use, and if there were stuck-on foodstuffs, I’d use some salt with a paper towel as a scouring agent.

I don’t recommend this. No one *likes* having dirty pans, and I found the results not that great anyway. I think the salt scrub can damage the seasoning.

Now I just throw my cast iron into the sink after I’ve washed the rest of the dishes, when the water is a little scummy and the soap has mostly broken down.

My sister got me a [chainmail cast iron scrubber](https://www.amazon.com/Ringer-Original-Stainless-Cleaner-Patented/dp/B00FKBR1ZG?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00FKBR1ZG) for Christmas a few years ago, and it has made the single biggest difference for my pans. I can’t recommend them enough. They get food off great, and leave the seasoning beautiful and smooth.
