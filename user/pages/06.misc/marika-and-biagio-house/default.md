Marika and Biagio bought a house above Lincoln Park. It's a pretty significant project, but it's in a great location (right across from SHT, near Lincoln Park bike trails, view of the lift bridge), but it will be beautiful when they're done with it. 

A friend of theirs said, "You guys took the strategy of buying the crappiest house in the neighborhood. Nice!"

I'm having a little house envy, so I'm going to live vicariously through them and follow their progress on this page.

They're cutting a hole in the side of the house for a sliding door from the living room out to the deck. Dad was there to help out this weekend.
